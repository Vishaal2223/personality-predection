# personality-predection
A machine learning-based system that predicts a person's personality type using psychological and demographic traits like age, gender, openness, and extraversion. Built using Python and Scikit-learn for real-world behavioral insights.
# 🧠 Personality Prediction System using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning-based system that predicts an individual's personality type based on psychological and demographic features. It uses user input like **age, gender, openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism**, and **extraversion** to classify the personality type.

This model can be used in various domains such as career guidance, mental health analysis, team building, and personalized digital experiences.
